# SmartRes2

The ultimate addon for party and raid recovery after a partial or total wipe. There is a plethora of features, most functional, some are for roleplay.

## A Short List of Features

Not every feature exits for every WoW version. For example, settings for mass resurrection spells are not available in Classic Era or Season of Discovery. I am still writing the code, which means there are features which are not done.

* SmartRes2 is lightweight and modular. You can enable or disable almost everything, up to and including entire plugins.
* Create your own random messages for printing to chat to entertain your group.
* Disable or remove chat messages you do not wish to use. There is a recycle bin to restore deleted messages.
* Customize the bar frame with borders, fonts, and more. Future ideas include supporting themes.
* Bind keys for one-click casting of your class resurrection spells, including Hunter pet spells (requires retail, crane and moth pets).
* Non-combat spells intelligently parse your group for dead characters, prioritizing healers, tanks, then DPS. The option to change the priority is being investigated.
* Non-combat resurrection spells, including mass resurrections, check if your cast is the fastest, and if anyone's spell is not the fastest, SmartRes2 can inform them of a collision.
* A frame of colour-coded bars provides a visual display of resurrections. (Not ready as of June, 2024).
* If you have a combat res spell, there is an option to switch the manual target key bind to the spell during combat, and back to your regular res spell out of combat.
* SmartRes2 supports all WoW versions that have been released as of June, 2024. The War Within is planned, but I do not have access to the beta.

## Translating

People can start localizing SmartRes2 via the [Wowace](https://www.wowace.com/projects/smartres2/localization) web portal. As of June 6, 2024, the current words and phrases are set; however, there will be more added and those added later may change as development progresses.

## API

Addon authors are welcome to write their own modules and plug their options into SmartRes2. There is a [Public API](https://github.com/Myrroddin/smartres2/wiki/Public-API) which has the basics. More instructions will be added as development advances.

These are not final, and are subject to change, especially as I add features.
